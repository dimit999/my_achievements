### Briefly About Myself:
  > I am a Head of QA & QA Automation Architect with over 13 years of experience in software testing, test automation, and quality assurance. Currently, I lead QA efforts for a FinTech & e-commerce platform in Dubai, overseeing a big team and ensuring high-quality product delivery.

  > In my role, I manage test strategy, automation, and quality control, distributing tasks among testers, defining QA processes, and tracking key metrics. I actively participate in grooming sessions, sprint planning, retrospectives, and cross-functional collaboration with PMs and developers to optimize the testing approach and enhance overall product quality.

  > With a strong background in automation, team leadership, and process optimization, I am passionate about driving QA efficiency, reducing release cycles, and implementing cutting-edge testing solutions to improve software quality.

### Skills:
  Technical stack:
  * Development languages: Python (full automation knowledge for any WEB/API/MOBILE projects), JS (Basic development knowledge: can fix UI bugs).

  For Python:
  * Tools/libraries for working with interfaces - Selenium, requests, axe, locust, MySQL/Mongo;
  * Tools for organizing and running tests - Pytest;
  * Structure and tools for a centralized runner - GitLab pipeline/GitHub actions/Jenkins;
  * Report generation tools - Allure, HTML;
  * Run of autotests on mobile devices (Android, iOS: via Appium).

  For JavaScript:
  * JS;
  * HTML;
  * CSS/SASS;
  * REACT (a little experience);
  * TS (a little experience).

  No issues with JavaScript/Java. I can quickly start to work with it.

  Additional frameworks experience: Playwright/TestNG and Junit.

  Performance: Jmeter/Locust/Requests + Selenium

  My responsibilities on a current project with Python language as a Head of QA || Automation Architect:
  * Cross-functional collaboration with product, development, and DevOps teams;<br>
  * Ensured quality across 5+ enterprise projects, maintaining defect leakage below 1% and preventing critical production defects;
  * Creating QA Automation platform for managing API/WEB/Native apps (Android/IOS);
  * Hiring, onboarding, and mentoring QA engineers;
  * Creating new solutions on Python: framework/testing solutions/pipeline configuration/QA dashboard (ReportPortal) configuration for viewing test results.<br>

Example of my created solutions :
 1. Python framework: for WEB automation: Chrome/FF/Safari/Edge, WEB for mobile devices (Android/IOS for emulators and real devices), Native app (Android/IOS).
 2. Python solutions: Cookies checker/Broken Links checker/JS errors checker/Accessibility testing/Localization testing.
 3. Python extended allure report.
 4. Pipeline configuration (Jenkins/can do the same in Github/Gitlab) for running tests remotely.
 5. Selenoid configuration (solution for running tests remotely)
 6. ReportPortal configuration (solution for showing test results) + info from JIRA + dev info(SonarQube/ZAP/Eslint/etc) with my personal additional features. Example: [Automation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15oCjCHdvzxboNM6KGG1qL3Ur30ma3Jc3/view?usp=sharing), [Jira](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tixR7-P3_9ziB9-08uZPTxBPwlLz95yI/view?usp=sharing).
